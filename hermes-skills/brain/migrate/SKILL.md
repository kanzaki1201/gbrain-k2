# Migrate Skill — Hermes Projection

This skill is the Hermes-native projection of the GBrain K2 `migrate` blueprint. Use it to keep Hermes aligned with the source workflow while executing through Hermes-standard tools.

## When to Use
Load this skill when work matches any of these blueprint triggers:
- migrate from
- import from obsidian
- import from notion
- Blueprint source: `/home/k/gbrain-k2/skills/migrate/SKILL.md`
- This projection keeps the source doctrine while translating execution into Hermes-standard tools and `gbrain` CLI commands.

## Quick Reference
| Need | Hermes move |
|---|---|
| Run `gbrain` commands | `terminal` |
| Read source blueprints or repo docs | `read_file` |
| Search markdown and docs | `search_files` |
| Edit local markdown or config | `patch` / `write_file` |
| Delegate a larger workflow | `delegate_task` |
| Schedule recurring checks | `cronjob` |

## Procedure
1. Read `references/blueprint.md` when exact K2 wording matters, then follow the source workflow exactly.
2. Use Hermes-native tools for execution: run `gbrain ...` through `terminal`, inspect local markdown with `read_file` and `search_files`, and patch files with `patch` or `write_file` when the task needs repository edits.
3. Keep the blueprint as the authority for filing rules, quality bar, and chaining behavior. Translate source-only tool names into Hermes capabilities instead of assuming custom GBrain tools exist inside Hermes.

### Blueprint Contract

- Source data is never modified or deleted; migration is additive only.
- Every migrated page is verified round-trip: written to gbrain, read back, spot-checked.
- Cross-references from the source system (wikilinks, block refs, tags) are converted to gbrain equivalents.
- Migration is tested on a sample (5-10 files) before bulk execution.
- Post-migration health check confirms page count, link integrity, and embedding coverage.

### Blueprint Phases

1. **Assess the source.** What format? How many files? What structure?
2. **Plan the mapping.** How do source fields map to gbrain fields (type, title, tags, compiled_truth, timeline)?
3. **Test with a sample.** Import 5-10 files, verify by reading them back from gbrain and exporting.
4. **Bulk import.** Import the full directory into gbrain.
5. **Verify.** Check gbrain health and statistics, spot-check pages.
6. **Build links.** Extract cross-references from content and create typed links in gbrain.

### Source Tool Intent

These are the operations the original blueprint expects. In Hermes, execute them through `gbrain` CLI commands in `terminal` or local file tools.

- Store/update pages in gbrain (put_page)
- Read pages from gbrain (get_page)
- Link entities in gbrain (add_link)
- Tag pages in gbrain (add_tag)
- Get gbrain statistics (get_stats)
- Check gbrain health (get_health)
- Search gbrain (query)

## Pitfalls
- **Bulk import without sample test.** Never import the full dataset before verifying with 5-10 files. The cost of cleaning up hundreds of bad pages is enormous.
- **Destroying source data.** Migration is additive. Never modify, move, or delete the source files.
- **Ignoring cross-references.** Wikilinks, block refs, and tags from the source system must be converted to gbrain equivalents. Dropping them loses the knowledge graph.
- **Skipping verification.** A migration without post-import health check, page count comparison, and spot-check reads is incomplete.
- Letting the Hermes projection drift from the blueprint. Run the blueprint audit whenever `gbrain-k2/skills/` changes.

## Verification
- Confirm the projection hash in this skill matches the current source blueprint.
- Run `python ~/gbrain-k2/scripts/audit-hermes-brain-skills.py` to verify blueprint parity and Hermes section conformance.
- When the task touched the brain itself, validate the result with the relevant `gbrain` CLI command before reporting success.
- Check the expected output/report shape from the blueprint:
